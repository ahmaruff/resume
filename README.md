# Resume

I used to store my resume in Word format, but I often lost track of the latest version. With HTML and Git, I can easily track changes and access my resume anytime. Just open it, **press Ctrl + P**, and it's ready to be printed or saved as a PDF.

I provide two versions of my resume: **Bahasa Indonesia** and **English**.

## Why This Approach?
I chose HTML and Git for my resume because traditional document formats often lead to versioning issues. Every time I updated my resume in Word, I ended up with multiple files like `resume_final.docx`, `resume_final_updated.docx`, and worse, `resume_final_updated_final.docx`. It became frustrating to track changes and ensure I was always using the correct version.

By using HTML and Git:
- I can store my resume in a **single place**, avoiding duplicate files.
- I get **version control**, so I can easily review and revert changes if needed.
- I can **access it online**, making it easy to retrieve whenever I need it.
- Printing is seamless with a **customized design** that ensures a polished output in PDF or paper format.
- The **HTML structure is ATS-friendly**, making it easier for Applicant Tracking Systems to parse my resume.
- By hosting it on **GitHub Pages**, I can print it anytime, anywhere, and even make temporary edits using **Inspect Element** before printing, without modifying the original file.

## Advantages
Using HTML and Git for my resume offers several benefits:
- **Always Up-to-Date** → No more confusion about the latest version.
- **Easily Accessible** → Can be opened from anywhere without additional software.
- **Optimized for Print & PDF** → Designed to remain neat when printed or converted to PDF.
- **Version History** → Easily track previous revisions.
- **Customizable** → Flexible layout and content to suit your needs.
- **ATS-Friendly** → Structured content that improves parsing accuracy in job application systems.
- **On-the-Fly Editing** → Can make quick changes using Inspect Element before printing, without modifying the source code.
