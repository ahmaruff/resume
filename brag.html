                <h3>(2023-08-06) I build a website using Tailwind CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    It's been a while since I found out about Tailwind CSS.
                    Its long & <em>messy</em> class names is always kept me away.
                    But, after playing around a little bit, those long class names are starting to make sense.
                    I used it in my latest project, where I built a company profile for a Web Programming Competition.
                    Even though I didn't win, I'm happy that I finally gave Tailwind CSS a try.

                <h3>(2023-07-31) Integrating Tiptap text editor to Laravel with AlpineJS</h3>
                <p>
                    When I initially searched for 'rich text editor' options,
                    I came across several alternatives. After conducting more research, the concept of  <a href="https://tiptap.dev/" target="_blank">Tiptap</a> resonated with me.
                    Despite reading through tiptap's documentation, I encountered challenges while trying to incorporate it into my  Laravel project.
                    The idea of directly connecting tiptap to the Livewire model didn't appeal to me.
                    Eventually, I decided to attempt integration by utilizing Alpine.js. I employed Alpine.js to temporarily store tiptap data,
                    which could then be transmitted to Laravel via the hidden form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following numerous days of grappling with the integration of tiptap's JavaScript code into Alpine.js and the Vite build tools,
                    I finally succeeded in creating a rich text editor within my Laravel project using tiptap
